        <h2>High Protein Trail Breakfast Latte</h2>
        <p>Quick and easy to make, this is a great drink to make to start the day.</p>
        <p>I would whip this up while making high-protein instant oatmeal, and then drink it while hiking.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One pouch of vanilla Carnation Breakfast Essentials</li>
            <li>One or two (to taste) small packets of instant coffee</li>
            <li>Slightly less than a liter of purified water, in a bottle</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure there is some room at the top of the water bottle</li>
            <li>Carefully pour the Breakfast Essentials into the water bottle and shake</li>
            <li>Carefully add the coffee and shake</li>
            <li>Enjoy with a high-protein breakfast or after you have started hiking</li>
        </ol>
